# Cultivate

Cultivate is a solo project build as our first fullstack project at App Academy.
Cultivate is an events website, similar to MeetUp, but with a new cultish theme. 
Users can join groups and attend events in order to get out and meet new people. 

The live site is available [here](https://aa-authenticate-me.onrender.com/).
